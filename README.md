# Oliver's Pronunciation Library
<p>This is a library of Japanese pronunciations made to cover words, expressions and abbreviations that JapanesePod101 doesn't (such as 即, 伝家の宝刀, and ウーロン). This library is optimised for use with <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net">Anki</a>, and can be hooked up to <a href="https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan">Yomichan</a>.</p>
<p>This is the repository for the backend and the index web page.</p>
