# Oliver's Pronunciation Library
<p>This is a collection of Japanese pronunciation audio files made to cover words, expressions and onomatopoeia that JapanesePod101 doesn't (such as 大貧民, 伝家の宝刀, and ふかふか). This library is optimised for use with <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net">Anki</a>, and can be hooked up to <a href="https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan">Yomichan</a>.</p>
<p>This is the repository for the website.</p>
